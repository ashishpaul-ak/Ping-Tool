# Ping Network Monitoring Tool

A comprehensive graphical network monitoring application that provides real-time ping monitoring capabilities with advanced visualization features.

## Overview

This Ping Network Monitoring Tool is a GUI-based application designed to monitor network connectivity across multiple IP addresses simultaneously. The tool offers both range-based IP input and file-based IP list management, along with detailed graphical representations of ping performance for each monitored host.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-IP Monitoring**: Monitor multiple IP addresses simultaneously
- **CIDR Range Support**: Input entire IP ranges using CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- **File Upload Support**: Upload text files containing lists of IP addresses to monitor
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous ping monitoring with configurable intervals
- **Graphical Visualization**: Individual ping graphs for each monitored IP address

### Advanced Features
- **Customizable Ping Intervals**: Adjustable ping frequency (default: 1 second)
- **Warning Thresholds**: Configurable latency warning levels (default: 100ms)
- **Dark Mode Interface**: Modern dark theme for comfortable monitoring
- **Statistical Analysis**: Min, Max, Average, and Current RTT values
- **Packet Loss Detection**: Real-time packet loss monitoring and reporting
- **Time-based Graphs**: 10-minute rolling window graphs with timestamps

### User Interface
- **Clean Dashboard**: Intuitive interface with organized monitoring results
- **Color-coded Status**: Visual indicators for connection status (Green: Good, Yellow: Warning, Red: Critical)
- **Individual Graph Windows**: Dedicated graph windows for each monitored IP
- **Export Capabilities**: Save graphs as PNG files and copy statistics

## Screenshots

The application features multiple components:

1. **Main Monitoring Dashboard**: Central interface showing all monitored IPs with their current status
2. **Individual Ping Graphs**: Detailed RTT graphs for each IP address showing:
   - Round-trip time measurements over time
   - Min/Max/Average values
   - Current connection status
   - Packet loss indicators
   - Time-stamped data points

## Technical Specifications

### Supported IP Formats
- Individual IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- CIDR notation ranges (e.g., 10.88.33.0/24)
- Comma or space-separated IP lists
- Text file uploads containing IP addresses

### Monitoring Capabilities
- **Ping Interval**: Configurable (1-60 seconds)
- **Graph Timeframe**: 10-minute rolling windows
- **Warning Threshold**: Customizable latency warnings
- **Concurrent Monitoring**: Multiple IPs monitored simultaneously
- **Data Export**: Statistics and graphs can be saved

### System Requirements
- Windows operating system
- .NET Framework (version dependent on implementation)
- Network connectivity for ping operations
- Sufficient system resources for concurrent monitoring

## Installation & Usage

### Basic Usage
1. **Launch the Application**: Run the Ping Network Monitoring Tool
2. **Configure IP Range**: 
   - Enter IP addresses manually in CIDR format (e.g., 10.88.33.1/20)
   - Or upload a text file containing IP addresses
3. **Set Parameters**:
   - Ping interval (seconds)
   - Warning threshold (milliseconds)
4. **Start Monitoring**: Click "Start Monitoring" to begin ping operations
5. **View Results**: Monitor real-time results in the main dashboard
6. **View Graphs**: Click "View Graph" for individual IP performance graphs

### Advanced Configuration
- **Filter Options**: Use the "Alive" filter to show only responsive hosts
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle dark mode for better visibility
- **Graph Timeframe**: Adjust the monitoring timeframe (default: 10 minutes)
- **Export Data**: Save statistics and graphs for reporting purposes

## Current Status & Known Issues

### Known Challenges
⚠️ **Critical Issue**: The application currently faces challenges when being converted into a standalone executable file. The main problem is:

- **Infinite Ping Execution**: When compiled as an executable, the ping operations may enter an infinite loop
- **System Resource Exhaustion**: This can lead to excessive CPU and memory usage
- **System Instability**: In severe cases, the never-ending ping execution can cause system crashes
- **Process Management**: Difficulty in properly terminating ping processes when the application is closed

### Current Workarounds
- The application works correctly when run in development environment
- Manual process termination may be required if the executable version is used
- Monitoring system resources is recommended when testing executable versions

### Development Status
The core functionality is complete and working, including:
- ✅ Multi-IP monitoring
- ✅ CIDR range support
- ✅ File upload functionality
- ✅ Real-time graphing
- ✅ Statistical analysis
- ✅ User interface and visualization
- ⚠️ **In Progress**: Executable deployment and process management

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Process Management**: Proper handling of ping processes in executable format
- **Enhanced Export Options**: CSV, JSON, and XML export formats
- **Historical Data**: Long-term data storage and analysis
- **Alert System**: Email/SMS notifications for connectivity issues
- **Network Topology**: Visual network mapping capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved resource usage for large-scale monitoring

### Technical Improvements
- **Memory Management**: Better handling of long-running monitoring sessions
- **Process Isolation**: Improved ping process management
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error recovery and reporting
- **Configuration Management**: Save/load monitoring configurations

## Contributing

This project is actively being developed to resolve the executable deployment issues. Contributions are welcome, particularly in the areas of:
- Process management and threading
- Memory optimization
- Error handling and recovery
- Cross-platform compatibility
